This software is a frontend for ivtv-tune, therefore it depends on ivtv-tune
to work. In Debian (which happens to be the distribution I develop and test
on), you can get this by installing the package "ivtv-utils".

For the scripts to work, you will also need the UI::Dialog-perl module, and
zenity. In Debian, this is as simple as installing the packages 
"libui-dialog-perl" and "zenity".

To install the perl-scripts, you run the following as root:

    make install

If further assistance is needed, you may try to send me an email, and I will
answer if I can.
