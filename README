===========
ivtvfe 0.10
===========

ivtvfe is a frontend for ivtv-tune. The purpose is to automatically scan for
channels, and to easily switch between these.

This is not a highly sophisticated piece of software in any way - but it makes
life simpler for people who zap manually between channels.

Feel free to send me feedback!
